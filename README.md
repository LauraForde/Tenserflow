# Tensorflow

> Emerging Technologies 4th Year [module](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/)  
> Taught by Dr Ian McLoughlin  
> Solve four [problems](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/tensorflow.html) based on the [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) data set using the Python package Tensorflow.

**Exercise 1 - Use Tensorflow to create model**  
We are to use Tensorflow to predict the species of Iris from the flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length.

**Exercise 2 - Split data into training & testing**  
We must split the Iris data into two sets; training and testing. To do this we are allowed to write our own code that will randomly seperate the data on the fly and investigate the best possbile way for this to do done.

**Exercise 3 - Train the model**  
We are expected to use the testing set to train the model.

**Exercise 4 - Test the model**  
We are to use the testing set to test the model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate of this.
